# password_lock
A simple python script that has a password lock

This is my first ever successful project in python which means
it isn't my best, but it is usable.

ATTENTION: ONLY FUCTIONAL IN COMMAND PROMPT!!!
Right click the python script, click Open In Terminal. Do not launch by python launcher. The script will close when you try to use it.

HOW TO USE
1: Download python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2: Click Code > Download Zip
3: Extract the zip and move to downloads or wherever you want to move it
4: left click an empty space on the folder and click open in terminal (or command prompt)
command instead: cd (path of script here)
5: run command python password_lock.py
6: Use it! (Enter S to set the password)
