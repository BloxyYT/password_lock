# password_lock
A simple python script that has a password lock

This is my first ever successful project in python which means
it isn't my best, but it is usable.

ATTENTION: ONLY FUCTIONAL IN COMMAND PROMPT!!!
Right click the python script, click Open In Terminal. Do not launch by python launcher. The script will close when you try to use it.
